Small pieces of Scala that replace whole frameworks.

Interesting classes:
 - com.n6.ews.bb.Blackboard: Actor based blackboard implementation. Concurrent and non-persistent.
 - com.n6.ews.ib.Topic: Pub-sub with Actors.


=======================

Requires:
 - Scala 2.7.5
 - Specs 1.2.5
 - Ant
 - Ivy


Thanks to robey for scala-build, a nice initial project setup.

=======================

Primary targets
---------------
  - clean
    - erase all generated/built files
  - distclean
    - clean *everything*
  - prepare
    - resolve dependencies and download them
  - compile
    - build any java/scala source
  - test
    - build and run test suite (requires e:testclass)
  - stress
    - (optional) run stress test suite (requires e:stresstestclass)
  - docs
    - generate documentation
  - package
    - copy all generated/built files into distribution folder
      (requires "local" repo)
  - push
    - copy all generated/built files into a final repository
      (requires "push" repo)


Properties that can change behavior
-----------------------------------

- skip.download
    if defined, don't download ivy; assume it's present
- skip.test
    if defined, don't run test suite
- skip.docs
    if defined, don't build docs
- libs.extra
    any extra files to copy into dist/<p>/libs/ during compile
- dist.extra
    any extra files to copy into dist/<p> during compile
- config.extra
    any extra files to copy into config/ during compile
- pack.deps
    if defined, pack dependent jars into the final dist jar, to remove dependencies
- thrift.bin
    location of the "thrift" executable
- push.build_name
    if defined, add the build name (and git revision) to jars when pushed to the repo
- dist.build_integration
    if defined, add the git revision to the name of the final distribution zip file, and
    don't use the version number in paths
- no.git
    if defined, don't try to fetch the current git head revision


Extra ivy thingies
------------------

- e:buildpackage
    causes a build.properties file to be created in the named package
    (stores version #, etc -- used by RuntimeEnvironment in configgy)
- e:thriftpackage
    output package for generated thrift classes; causes thrift DDLs to be
    compiled
- e:testclass
    class to execute for unit tests -- required, in order to run tests
- e:stresstestclass
    class to execute for stress tests (optional)
- e:checktestclass
    class to execute for scalacheck tests (optional)
- e:jarclassname
    creates an executable jar with this as the main class name
